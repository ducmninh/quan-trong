"""Persistent save: gold + character upgrades + owned guns + owned pets.

Stored in ``save.json`` next to settings.py. Loaded once at game start and
written every time the player visits the Hub or completes a level.

The save is intentionally permissive: missing fields fall back to defaults
so older saves still work after we add more upgrades / weapons / pets.
